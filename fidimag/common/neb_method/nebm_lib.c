     * We assume we have n_images images in the band, which is represented by
     * the *y array. the *y array has the structure

     *      y = [ theta0_0 phi0_0 theta0_1, phi0_1  ... phi0_(n_dofs_images),

     * where (theta(i)_j, phi(i)_j) are the spherical coordinates of the j-th
     * spin in the i-th image of the band. Thus we have n_dofs_image spins per
     * image. Images at the extremes, i=0,(n_images-1), are kept fixed, thus we
     * do not compute the tangents for them.
     *
     * The *energies array contains the energy of every image, thus its length
     * is n_images.
     *
     * The tangents have the same length of an image, thus the *tangents array
     * has length (n_images * n_dofs_image), just as the *y array, and we keep
     * the first and last n_dofs_image components as zero (they correspond to
     * the extreme images)
     *
     * To compute the tangents, we use the t+ and t- vectors. Denoting the i-th
     * image by Y_i, these vectors are defined by

     *      t+_i = Y_(i+1) - Y_i          t-_i = Y_i - Y_(i-1)

     * Then, when an image is at a saddle point, we have, using the energies
     * of the neighbouring images,:

     *               __
     *      t_i  =   |   t+_i    if  E_(i+1) > E_i > E_(i-1)

     *               |_  t-_i    if  E_(i+1) < E_i < E_(i-1)

     * Otherwise, if we have a maximum or a minimum  (E_(i+1) < E_i > E_(i-1)
     * or E_(i+1) > E_i < E_(i-1) respectively), we use an average of the
     * vectors:
     *
                     __
     *      t_i  =   |   t+_i * dE_max + t-_i * dE_min  if  E_(i+1) > E_(i-1)
     *              <
     *               |_  t+_i * dE_min + t-_i * dE_max  if  E_(i+1) < E_(i-1)

     * where dE_max = max( |E_(i+1) - E_i|, |E_i - E_(i-1)|) and
